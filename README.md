## System Requirements

Please make sure that you have successfully installed the below software on your development environment, before interacting with this repo.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. We will use the latest LTS version.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - is the official Nodejs Package Manager (npm) which allows us to manage our dependencies and packages. It is automatically installed with nodejs, so you don't have to install it separately.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - our recommended code editor. It's available on all platforms, supports many languages, and offers a variety of useful extensions.
  - [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (extension) - a local development server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) / [GitHub account](https://github.com/) - a version control system for source code. Github is a community site that allows easy creation and collaboration on git projects

## Verifying installation

After installing node please verify that you have setup everything correctly by typing the below commands on your terminal:

- `node -v` ➡️ `v20.12.2` (any version >= 18 is fine, in my case the version is specifically v20.12.2)
- `npm -v` ➡️ `10.5.0` (any version >= 9 is fine, in my case the version is specifically 10.5.0)
