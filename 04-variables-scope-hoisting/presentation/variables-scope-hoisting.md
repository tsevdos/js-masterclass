# Rules

Feel free to interrupt me for:

- questions
- relevant comments

---

# Agenda

- variable declaration and naming
- var, let, and const
- variable scope
- hoisting

---

# Variable declaration

- var
- let
- const

---

# Variable names

- names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
- names must begin with a letter
- names can also begin with **$** and **\_**
- names are case-sensitive (x and X are different variables)
- reserved words (JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

---

# Variable scope

- **global scope**: the default scope for all code running in script mode
- **module scope**: the scope for code running in module mode
- **function scope**: the scope created with a function

---

# Variable scope

- **var**: function scope
- **let** or **const**: block scope

---

# Hoisting

**Hoisting** refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

# Happy coding!
