- Advantages and Disadvantages

# Introduction

**JavaScript** is a versatile, high-level programming language that is integral to modern web development, enabling **interactive and dynamic content in websites and applications**.

---

# Brendan Eich and Netscape

**Brendan Eich**, was hired in April 1995 by **Netscape**, and was initially commissioned to insert **Scheme**, a functional programming language, in the **Netscape browser**.

# Brendan Eich and Netscape

In just **10 days** Brendan created one with the Scheme functionality, Self's typical object orientation and Java-like syntax. The first version was called **Mocha**, then renamed **LiveScript** and finally **JavaScript**.

# Timeline

- **May 1995**: Project Mocha starts
- **September 1995**: Project release as LiveScript
- **December 1995**: Renamed to JavaScript
- **1996**: it was standardized as ECMAScript to ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association)
- **ECMAScript** is a standardized specification ensuring compatibility across implementations and settings, while **JavaScript** implements with environment-specific features

---

# Timeline

- **ECMA Technical Committee 39** – also known as **TC39** – is the committee which defines **ECMAScript** (**JavaScript**) and related standards
- **ES1**: June 1997 (ECMA-262)
- **ES2**: June 1998
- **ES3**: December 1999
- **ES4**: Abandoned

---

# Timeline

- **ES5**: December 2009
  - Many improvments in OOP
  - Strict mode
  - JSON
- The same year (2009), **node.js** a JavaScript runtime is running JS code on the server!

---

# Timeline

- **ES2015 (or ES6)**: June 2015
  - classes
  - arrow functions
  - promises
  - template strings
  - transpilers (babel and tracer)
- **ES2016 - ES2024**

---

# JavaScript Usage

- **Web Development**: Client-side (React, Angular) and Server-side (Node.js, Deno)
- **Mobile Apps**: PWAs, React Native, Ionic
- **Desktop Apps**: Electron, NW.js
- **IoT**: Johnny-Five, Espruino

---

# JavaScript Advantages

- Native language for browsers: Universally supported by all major browsers
- Open standard: Governed by ECMA International, promoting broad compatibility
- Huge community: Extensive resources, support, and contributions from developers worldwide
- Rich ecosystem: Numerous tools, frameworks, libraries, and plugins available for diverse needs

---

# JavaScript Disadvantages

- Quirks: Issues with inheritance, type coercion, and browser inconsistencies
- Fragmentation: Multiple environments (browser engines, Node.js, Deno, Bun) can lead to compatibility challenges
- Overabundance of tools: The vast number of tools and frameworks can be overwhelming and lead to decision fatigue

# Happy coding!
